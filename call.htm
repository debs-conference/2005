<h3><A NAME="goal"></A>Goal</h3><p>The 
purpose of this workshop is to bring together people from academia and industry 
interested in the foundations, implementation, and application of all aspects 
of event-based middleware, from traditional topic-based and content-based publish-subscribe, 
to event correlation, streaming queries, mediations, and systems integration. 
We seek contributions from practitioners in industry and government, as well as 
from academic and industrial researchers.</p><h3><A NAME="theme"></A>Workshop 
Theme</h3><P>Event-based systems are those in which information provided by producers 
is distributed in a timely manner to interested consumers via messaging middleware. 
A common service interface provided by event-based systems is the publish-subscribe 
paradigm: </P><UL><LI>producers and consumers can be mutually anonymous, </LI><LI>producers 
deliver events to topics, </LI><LI>each consumer specifies interest by means of 
a &quot;subscription&quot;, and later receives events of interest via event notifications</LI></UL><P>The 
middleware is responsible for consolidating subscriptions and propagating events. 
Queuing and hybrids of publish-subscribe and queuing are also popular. Event-based 
systems can be used to integrate a wide range of components into a loosely-coupled 
distributed system.</P><P>For example, </P><UL><LI>event producers can be application 
components, post-commit triggers in a database, sensors, or system monitors; </LI><LI>event 
consumers can be application components, device controllers, databases, workflow 
queues, etc. </LI></UL><P>These systems are seeing increasingly widespread use, 
in applications ranging from time-critical systems, system management and control, 
to e-commerce. Publish-subscribe services have been incorporated into standards 
such as CORBA and JMS, and into commercial systems, such as offerings of IBM and 
TIBCO. </P><P>Traditional event-based systems support subscriptions based on topics, 
or based on filter predicates on message content; the middleware service delivers 
copies of published messages to some subset of all subscribers. An emerging new 
area of interest is the extension of these services to include transformation, 
aggregation, and correlation of events. For example, a subscription to published 
events of stock trades and offers to trade may ask for </P><UL><LI> a continuous 
running average of stock trades on a certain company; or</LI><LI>alerts indicating 
that more than 100 trades for the same stock issue have been made in the same 
hour; or </LI><LI>notifications that a request to buy and a request to sell have 
been made on the same issue with matching offer price ranges. </LI></UL><P>As 
with traditional publish-subscribe, it is still desired that</P><UL><LI>publishers 
and subscribers remain anonymous, </LI><LI>subscribers are independent and can 
possibly dynamically enter and leave, </LI><LI>the system should push events from 
publishers to subscribers as quickly as possible, and </LI><LI>the implementation 
should scale to large numbers of clients. </LI></UL><P>Many applications of this 
nature are built today by combining publish-subscribe systems with other client-side 
systems to perform the additional computation. The interest in these problems 
overlaps with other system areas -- specifically streaming systems, continuous 
query and continuous view update systems in databases, correlation engines, and 
system monitoring and management tools. It is our goal to provide cross-fertilization 
between researchers and practitioners in these areas with researchers and practitioners 
in traditional event-based middleware. </P><P>The purpose of this workshop is 
to bring together people from academia and industry interested in the foundations, 
implementation, and application of all aspects of event-based middleware, from 
traditional topic-based and content-based publish-subscribe, to event correlation, 
streaming queries, mediations, and systems integration. We seek contributions 
from practitioners in industry and government, as well as from academic and industrial 
researchers. </P><P>Papers do not have to be based on complete and comprehensive 
works. In fact, we welcome position papers, requirements for real-world applications, 
as well as papers based on preliminary results, provided that they are forward-looking 
and that they remain well-argued and justified in terms of existing work. </P><H3><A NAME="topics"></A>Workshop

ideas in the area of event-based systems. Therefore, we invite authors interested 
in event-based applications, event-based infrastructures, and event correlation
