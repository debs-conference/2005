be introduced and stimulated by presentations.</P>

<H2>Brief Description</H2><P>Event-based systems are systems in which 
producers deliver events, and in which messaging middleware delivers events to 
consumers based upon their previously specified interest. One typical usage pattern 
of such systems is the publish-subscribe paradigm, in which producers and consumers 
are mutually anonymous, and in which producers deliver events to topics, and each 
subscriber separately and independently registers a specification of its particular 
interest; the system then receives events from producers and in a timely fashion 
propagates (possibly transforms) and delivers these events. A second popular event-based 
usage paradigm is queuing; hybrids of publish-subscribe and queuing are also possible. 
These paradigms are popular because of their ease of use and high degree of decoupling, 
and because efficient and highly scalable implementations are available. </P><P>Event-based 
systems are widely used for integrating loosely coupled application components, 
including sensors, device controllers, and databases. The use of event-based systems 
is expanding, and an increasing number of commercial systems are offering messaging 
middleware components. There is a wide interest in techniques both for extending 
the capabilities and for improving the performance and ease of use of such systems. 
</P><P>Traditionally, the DEBS workshop has covered all aspects of the design, 
implementation, performance analysis, and application and deployment of distributed 
event-based systems. We propose to continue soliciting submissions relating to 
these core topics, and also to encourage submissions relating to (1) user experience 
and user requirements in realistic application scenarios from industry and government, 
and (2) requirements and solutions that extend the traditional event-based paradigms 
(publish-subscribe and queuing) beyond the standard content-based filtering, to 
include also transforms, aggregations, event mediations, and event-correlation. 
We specifically seek to encourage cross-fertilizations with such research areas 
as stream processing, continuous queries, continuous view updates, and rule-based 
event correlation. We wish to avoid, for example, the database communities and 
the messaging communities independently studying and solving overlapping problems 
and developing separate architectures and vocabularies for related concepts. We 
seek a balance between research studies relating to design and implementation 
of such systems, and presentations of either actual experience with the use of 
such systems for a real problem, or requirements for future systems to solve projected 
real problems. Researchers need to make sure they are studying important problems; 
potential users need to understand the directions in evolving technologies. Since 
this is a workshop, we encourage position paper and works in progress rather than 
polished results. </P><!-- #EndEditable --> <!-- ****************************************************** -->
